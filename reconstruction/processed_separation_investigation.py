──────────────────────────────────────
Determines whether the Siemens-PROCESSED threshold data is CUMULATIVE (nested
thresholds A⊇B⊇C⊇D, photons shared between thresholds) or ALREADY EXCLUSIVE
(disjoint energy bins), using the gain-invariant inter-threshold NOISE
correlation.  This settles whether the subtraction studied by
image_subtraction_investigation.py / sinogram_subtraction_investigation.py is
even the right operation, or whether Siemens already separated the bins (in which
case the pipeline's cumulative assumption would be wrong).

WHY NOISE CORRELATION IS THE DISCRIMINATOR (and gain-invariant)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- CUMULATIVE (nested): every photon counted in a higher threshold is also counted
  in the lower ones, so the thresholds share quantum noise → STRONG positive
  inter-threshold noise correlation (~0.7-0.95).
- EXCLUSIVE (disjoint windows): the bins count DIFFERENT photons → independent
  Poisson noise → NEAR-ZERO correlation.
Per-threshold gain / HU calibration only SCALES each threshold; a scale factor
cannot create or destroy a correlation, so this test is immune to the very
calibration that breaks the A≥B≥C≥D magnitude ordering (CLAUDE.md invariant #3).
Reconstruction is applied per threshold (no cross-threshold mixing), so the
cross-threshold noise correlation measured in a uniform ROI of the reconstructed
volumes equals that of the input threshold data.

SIGNAL vs NOISE: all four volumes image the same object, so their STRUCTURE is
highly correlated whether cumulative or exclusive (~0.98).  Only the NOISE
correlation distinguishes them — that is the number this script keys on.
